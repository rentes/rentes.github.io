Hi! My name is Miguel Rentes and I am a software engineer from Porto, Portugal.

I love programming in Python, Ruby, and Objective-C. I also love typography, functional programming, LaTeX, and touchtyping in my 1991 IBM Model M keyboard. I use Emacs as my text editor of choice. I work in Mac OS at home and Arch Linux at the office.

I created this blog because I like to write about software and to share knowledge in the process. Feel free to [e-mail me](mailto:miguel.rentes@gmail.com) or leave a comment on any of my blog posts. You can find more information about me on the bottom links.

Thank you very much for reading my blog.

Regards!
