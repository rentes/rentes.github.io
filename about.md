Hi! My name is Miguel Rentes and I am a software engineer.

I write this blog on different software topics, because I like to talk
about software and to share knowledge. This blog is also a great way
to get your feedback so we can all learn more about software construction.

Feel free to e-mail me on any software related topic or leave a
comment on my blog posts.

Thank you very much for reading my blog.

Regards!
