Hi! I am Miguel Rentes and I am a software engineer.

I write this blog on different software topics, because I like to talk about
software and this is also a great way for me to get your feedback on what I
write and possibly learn more about it from your own experience.

Feel free to e-mail me on any software related topic or on my blog posts.

Thank you very much for viewing my blog.

Regards!
