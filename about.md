Hi! My name is Miguel Rentes and I am a software engineer.

I write this blog on different software topics, because I like to talk about software and to share knowledge. This blog is also a great way for me to get your feedback so we can all learn more about software construction.

Feel free to e-mail me on any software related topic or leave a comment on my blog posts.

You can find more information about me on my [about.me][about-me] page.

Thank you very much for reading my blog.

Regards!
