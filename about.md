Hi! My name is Miguel Rentes and I am a software engineer from Porto, Portugal.

I created this blog because I like to write about software and share knowledge in the process. This blog is also a great way for me to get your feedback so we can all learn more about software construction or any related topic.

Feel free to [e-mail me](mailto:miguel.rentes@gmail.com) or leave a comment on any of my blog posts. You can find more information about me on the bottom links.

Thank you very much for reading my blog.

Regards!
