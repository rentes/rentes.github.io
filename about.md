| <img src="/img/me.png" width="150px" height="186px" title="Miguel Rentes" /> | Hi! My name is Miguel Rentes and I am a software engineer from Porto, Portugal. I love programming in Python, Ruby, and Javascript, under Emacs which is my favorite text editor. I also love typography, typesetting beautiful documents in <span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>, and touchtyping in my 1991 IBM Model M keyboard. I work in Mac OS at home and Arch Linux at the office.|
