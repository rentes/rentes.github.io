Hi! My name is Miguel Rentes and I am a software engineer.

I write this blog on different software topics, because I like to talk
about software and this is also great for me to get your feedback and
possibly learn more about software.

Feel free to e-mail me on any software related topic or leave a
comment on my blog posts.

Thank you very much for reading my blog.

Regards!
