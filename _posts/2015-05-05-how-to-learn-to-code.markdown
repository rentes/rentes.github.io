If you are starting to learn how to code, here is some great piece of advice.

I think the best advice in the video is to not learning a specific language just because someone told you to do it. Instead, start by choosing a set of problems you would love to have the computer solve for you, and then choose the programming language which is best suited for that problem context. Don't waste your time learning a programming language that you will not use to achieve your goals.
