This week I found out dev.life interviews from [Fog Creek][fogcreek]. These dev
interviews are a great resource to find out what other developers are
working on, how they started programming, what inspires them, and most importantly (at least, for me) how they
work and how they manage to stay focused when producing software.

One of the developers I follow for a couple of years now, Peteris Krumins,
did a dev.life interview recently where he talks about very interesting topics:
what software related books he loves, how is his dev environment and
how he enters "into the zone" to get the job done. You can read all
the dev.life interview with Peteris Krumins (click on the image):

Inspired by this interview, I also did a search for more dev.life
interviews available at the [fog creek blog][fogcreek-blog]. These are the results I
found, so far:
